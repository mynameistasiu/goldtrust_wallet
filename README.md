GoldTrust - Updated (HD design + header + animations)
This is an upgraded scaffold produced by ChatGPT. Changes made:
- New responsive header with theme toggle and mobile menu (components/LogoHeader.js)
- New Layout wrapper (components/Layout.js) with footer and improved container
- Enhanced styles in styles/globals.css (theme variables, animations, better card styles)
- Public logo added (public/logo.svg)
- Pages copied from your uploaded project (pages/*)
- Utils copied (utils/*)
- package.json added with recommended dependencies (install with npm/yarn)

How to run:
1. Move this folder into your development workspace.
2. Run: npm install
3. Run: npm run dev

Notes:
- This update keeps your app logic intact. It improves UI and adds theme toggle and responsive header.
- For richer animations consider installing 'framer-motion' and integrating into page components.
